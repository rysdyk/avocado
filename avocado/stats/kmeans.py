def weighted_counts(points, counts, k):
    """
    Calculate and return the weighted count of each centroid.

    Performs k-means clustering in order to identify the centroids and the
    distances between all points and their centroids. Weights and distances
    for the centroids are then constructed from all the points in that
    centroids cluster. Using those values, the weighted count is computed for
    each of the centroids and returned along with the centroid themselves. The
    points returned are a list of point objects where each point in the list
    has a list of 'values' representing the centroid coordinates and a 'count'
    which is the weighted count as computed for that centroid. Also returned
    is the list of outlier indexes in the 'points' list as determined by the
    k-means algorithm.

    Arguments:
        points - list of n-dimensional points to run k-means on.
        counts - the count for each point in the 'points' list. This list
                 must be of the same length as the 'points' list because the
                 count for a point is determined by accessing both 'points'
                 and 'counts' with the same index.
        k - the number of clusters(k-value) to send to the k-means algorithm.

    Returns:
        centroid_counts - A list of points where each point has 'values' list
        containing the coordinates of the centroid it is associated with and a
        'count' which is an integer representing the weighted count as
        computed for that centroid.
        outliers - A list of indexes of the outliers in 'point's as returned
        by the k-means algorithm.
